## Synthesium: for world builders, story tellers, lore trackers, and anyone holding a universe in their head

Synthesium is a made-up software tool for worldbuilders, lore-trackers, and story-writers.  The main purpose is to make information recording and categorization more streamlined.  It allows for a reorganizable visual layout, multiple modes of displaying information, and an intuitive tagging system that allows for as much customization the user desires.  

The name, Synthesium is a portmanteau of "synthesis" and "arcanium" (which is itself a portmanteau of "arcane" and "compendium").  The original inspiration for this product is from my own dreams of a tool that I could use to categorize all of the lore and knowledge of spellcraft from my favorite trio of book series from the same author: __The Arinthian Line__, __Fury of a Rising Dragon__, and __The Chronicles of Anna Atticus Stone__ by [Sever Bronny](https://severbronny.com/).  Magic in this book series is known as "arcanery," and thus an arcanium would serve to collect all knowledge about arcanery.  

Cataloguing and recording information about an entire book universe and a rich magic system that takes place across 12 books (and more being released every year) would requrire an equally rich categorization system, and thus my idea for this product was born.
