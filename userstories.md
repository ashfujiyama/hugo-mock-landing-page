# User Stories for Synthesium

Synthesium is a made-up software tool for worldbuilders, lore-trackers, and story-writers.  The main purpose is to make information recording and categorization more streamlined.  It allows for a reorganizable visual layout, multiple modes of displaying information, and an intuitive tagging system that allows for as much customization the user desires.  

The name, Synthesium is a portmanteau of "synthesis" and "arcanium" (which is itself a portmanteau of "arcane" and "compendium").  The original inspiration for this product is from my own dreams of a tool that I could use to categorize all of the lore and knowledge of spellcraft from my favorite trio of book series from the same author: __The Arinthian Line__, __Fury of a Rising Dragon__, and __The Chronicles of Anna Atticus Stone__ by Sever Bronny.  Magic in this book series is known as "arcanery," and thus an arcanium would serve to collect all knowledge about arcanery.  

Cataloguing and recording information about an entire book universe and a rich magic system that takes place across 12 books (and more being released every year) would requrire an equally rich categorization system, and thus my idea for this product was born.

Note that while many of my user stories are ones that I personally resonate with, I attempt to add different perspectives of other users who may use it.

## All Features (TODO: delete)

1. Categorization system through tagging (and tag hierarchies).  Tags can also serve as visual buckets. Tags and categories can also have a symbolic representation, either an icon provided by the software or uploaded by the user.

2. Search feature and tag filters.  The ability to toggle between set operations (union, intersection, minus) for more complexity when filtering using more than one tag.

3. Collaboration Feature: syncronize information across multiple accounts instantly, moderation system to ensure integrity and persisting meaning of categorization system, and viewing restrictions.

4. Multiple ways to store and display collected information: paragraphs, lists, bullets, graphs, timelines, notecards, connections displayed like edges.  The ability to treat each display component as an individual item to move and rearrange on screen.

5. Easy reordering and recategorization of information.  Ability to have a "dumping ground" that can later be tagged and split up.  Notification system if I'm adding redundant information that could be found in another location.

6. Customizability of experience: provide an intuitive system to start with, and have a setting to turn on "customize mode" which allows you to add default keyboard shortcuts or even create your own automations and shortcuts.

## All Stories (TODO: delete)

As a world builder with a large volume of lore to track, I want to search through the collection of information for specific keywords and pull information from different locations to make consolidation of knowledge easier.

As a future world builder, I would like a rich yet easy categorization system, i.e. characters, locations, artifacts, elements, etc to develop my world in an organized manner.

As a fan of a high fantasy book series, I want this system to be easily updatable so that when the author releases his next book, I can easily insert the new info.

As an artist, I would like a collaboration feature and a way to upload/display photos so that I can collaborate with writers by taking pre-collected descriptions from the Sythesium and turning them into art that could be also added to the compendium.

As a member of a fandom, I would like a collaborative feature that allows others to add their own collected information about the series while still maintaining the organizational structure and avoiding redundant information being recorded.

As a visual thinker, I would like to organize the information into nodes/notecards and create a graph that lays out the information I collected so far and allows me to define the connection between info cards so that I have an easier time connecting big concepts with smaller details.  

As a book fan, I would like to add citations on where the information is found, so that I could order the information chronologically within a category, if applicable.

As a writer, I would want a way to export collections of information onto another medium like Google Docs so that writing could be streamlined.

As a book fan especially interested in extensive lore development, I want an organizational system that is easily scalable so that I can use it on larger projects for large book series (10+ books with each book being on average 600+ pages).

As a book fan, I want to gather the lore that is quite scattered across many books and put them into robust yet flexible containers so that it is easy to search for the information manually and reduce redundancy.

As a TTRPG DM (table top role playing game dungeon master), I want to organize information both spatially and temporally to better conceptualize the environment and make campaigns run smoothly.

As a TTRPG DM (table top role playing game dungeon master), I want to add a privacy feature so that my players are allowed to access information that they have learned in game, while keeping information about unfamiliar locations or characters locked from their view.

As a writer, I want a variety of ways to display my collated information (i.e. lists, paragraphs, bullets, tables, visual timeline) and the ability to move information cards around on my screen for more flexibility.

As a person categorizing an extensive lore system, I want to be able to zoom in and out of the scope easily, so that I could switch between detailed and narrow views and overviews very quickly.

As a visual thinker, I want the categorizations to include the option for icons to make referencing quicker and easier.

As a long term writer, I want automation features to organize my lore, so that I could spend the least amount of time possible managing the system so I could focus on my writing.

As someone who is not tech-savvy, I want the system to be simple to learn and use, so that I don’t have to spend much time learning it and facing frustration.

As someone who wants to record a lot of world lore, I want the ability to integrate it with cloud systems so that losing a local copy would not mean the loss of my entire world.

As someone who enjoys keyboard shortcuts on software such as google docs, I want the ability to make my use more efficient by having similar shortcuts, additional shortcuts for repetitive actions, and the ability to switch shortcuts on and off to make learning how to use the interface quickly is easy.

As someone lacking good organizational skills, I want suggestions or examples of ways to categorize information that I currently have.

As someone with ADHD, I want a tag of “uncategorized info” so that I could dump a lot of information at once and return to tagging them later

As someone who tends to word-dump, I want to be able to put a lot of information all on one page, and go back later to split the information and reorder it to my liking.

As someone with an extensive lore, I want to be notified if I am writing redundant information (i.e. I have already made this notecard before) so that my system doesn’t become too unwieldy
